- 👋 Hi, I’m Grim97 💀
- 👀 My github either remains dormant for some time(coz I'll be learning some stuffs) or gets updated often(being honest)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and practicing C++, Python, Linux and Embedded stuffs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mini projects(Automotive or embedded) and stuffs that need to be automated!
